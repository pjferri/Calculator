# Description
Check out this calculator I made with Python. It has some advanced features like calculating sin, cos, tan and a lot more! It has a really awesome UI that goes along with it and the code is neatly commented so you know what everything does. 

# Instructions
This script uses tkinter to create a UI for the calculator so you might just have to install that library with pip installer (or a similar alternative). I made this is VSCode. The reason it's labeled calc10.py is because this is my 10th iteration of the calculator.

# Usage
Feel free to expand on this or use it however you like.
